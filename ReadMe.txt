Building steps:
1. Open the "CYKAlgorithm" folder in terminal.
2. Type "mkdir build" to make a directory.
3. Go into the build directory and type "cmake .." and "make" to build the project.
4. Type "./CYKAlgorithm [Chomsky normal form CFG file path]" to run the project.

This project will load the CFG file into the main memory and receive a user-input string. The project will print whether the string is accepted by the CFG or not.
